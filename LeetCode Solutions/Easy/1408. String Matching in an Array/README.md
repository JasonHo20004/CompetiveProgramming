# String Matching in an Array

## Problem Description
Given an array of strings `words`, return all strings in `words` that are a substring of another string in `words`. You can return the answer in any order.

## Approach

### Overview
The goal is to identify all strings in the input array that are substrings of any other string in the same array. To achieve this, we use a nested loop to compare each string with every other string in the array.
