# LeetCode Problem 1930: Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences

## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, return the number of unique palindromic subsequences of length 3 that are present in `s`.

A **palindromic subsequence** is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward. A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence where some elements may be deleted without changing the order of the remaining elements.
