# Solution Approach for LeetCode Problem 2381: Shifting Letters II

## Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` of lowercase English letters and a 2D integer array `shifts` where `shifts[i] = [starti, endi, directioni]`. For each shift, you need to shift the characters in the substring `s[starti:endi]` by `directioni` places. If `directioni` is `1`, shift to the right; if `directioni` is `0`, shift to the left.

## Approach

### 1. Understanding the Problem
The problem requires us to apply multiple shifts to different substrings of the given string `s`. Each shift can be either to the right or to the left. The challenge is to efficiently apply these shifts without repeatedly iterating over the entire substring for each shift operation.

### 2. Efficient Shift Calculation Using Difference Array
To efficiently handle multiple shifts, we can use a difference array. The idea is to mark the start and end of each shift interval and then compute the cumulative shifts for each position in the string.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialize a Difference Array**:
   - Create a difference array `shiftDel` of size `n + 1` (where `n` is the length of the string `s`). This array will help us keep track of the start and end of shifts.

2. **Mark Shift Intervals**:
   - For each shift `[start, end, direction]` in the `shifts` array:
     - If `direction` is `1` (right shift), increment `shiftDel[start]` by `1` and decrement `shiftDel[end + 1]` by `1`.
     - If `direction` is `0` (left shift), decrement `shiftDel[start]` by `1` and increment `shiftDel[end + 1]` by `1`.

3. **Compute Cumulative Shifts**:
   - Initialize a variable `current` to `0`. This will keep track of the cumulative shift at each position.
   - Iterate through the string and update `current` by adding `shiftDel[i]` to it. This gives the net shift at position `i`.
   - Calculate the new character by shifting the current character by `current` positions in the alphabet. Use modulo `26` to handle wrap-around cases.

4. **Update the String**:
   - For each character in the string, update it to the new character calculated in the previous step.

### 3. Implementation Details
- **Handling Modulo Operations**:
  - To ensure that the modulo operation works correctly for negative shifts, we use the formula `((s[i] - 'a' + current) % 26 + 26) % 26`. This ensures that the result is always a non-negative number between `0` and `25`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If there are no shifts, the string remains unchanged.
  - If the string is empty, the result is also an empty string.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `m` is the number of shifts. This is because we iterate through the string once to apply the shifts and once through the shifts to mark the intervals.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the difference array `shiftDel`.

## Example
Consider the string `s = "abc"` and the shifts `[[0, 1, 0], [1, 2, 1]]`:
- After processing the first shift `[0, 1, 0]`, the difference array becomes `[-1, 1, 0, 0]`.
- After processing the second shift `[1, 2, 1]`, the difference array becomes `[-1, 2, -1, 0]`.
- The cumulative shifts are `[0, -1, 1, 0]`, resulting in the string `"zab"`.

## Conclusion
By using a difference array, we can efficiently apply multiple shifts to different substrings of the string in linear time. This approach avoids the need for nested loops and significantly improves the performance for large inputs.
